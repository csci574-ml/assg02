    already added), and the target regression values y, fit a
    statsmodel OLS (ordinary least squares) regression model to the
    data and return the fitted model along with important fit parameters.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y - The expected set of regression targets in order to get the expected
        fitted regression model for task 1
    X - The expected set of features to train with, with an already added
        dummy intercept constant, in order to get the expected
        fitted regression model for Task 1

    Returns
    -------
    model, intercept, slope, mse, rmse, r2score - Returns a tuple of the fitted
        model, along with some parameters from the fit, including the slope and
        intercept, mse, rmse and r2 score

    Tests
    -----
    # these tests assume X and y are already defined in envrionment where
    # the doctests are called, and even more that the particular dataframe and
    # expected X input features and y regression targets are being used that
    # will produce the expected model and results from fitting the model
