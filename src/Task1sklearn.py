def task1_sklearn(X, y):
    """
    Given the asked for features X and the target regression
    values y, fit a sklearn linear regression model to the data
    and return the fitted model.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X - The expected set of features to train with in order to get the expected
        fitted regression model for Task 1
    y - The expected set of regression targets in order to get the expected
        fitted regression model for task 1

    Returns
    -------
    model, intercept, slope, mse, rmse, rsquared - Returns a tuple of the fitted
        model, along with some parameters from the fit, including the slope and
        intercept, mse, rmse and r2 score

    Tests
    -----
    # these tests assume X and y are already defined in envrionment where
    # the doctests are called, and even more that the particular dataframe and
    # expected X input features and y regression targets are being used that
    # will produce the expected model and results from fitting the model
